Welcome to my first project, a simple portfolio page for a freelancer photographer.  
It was great to see the overall picture from design to code. Using the basics of ES6, React, Gatsby and GraphQL is challenging bit absolutely worth it. The hosting and a simple CI/CD pipeline is handled with Netlify which is connected to a GitHub repository. 

The main goal is to reach the point when it's connected to a CMS, like Wordpress or Netlify.
So the admin can update and upload content directly from the content management system.

I will keep you posted! 

## 🚀 Quick start

first:

<code>npm install</code>

then:

<code>gatsby develop</code>

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this project.

    .
    ├── node_modules

    ├──── components
    ├──── content
    ├────── assets
    ├──── fonts

    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that the project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site (what you see in the browser).

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of the code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about the site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.


8. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for the project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

9. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
